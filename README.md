# Wasteland

I started making a game in a psuedo terminal-style way, using ASCII graphics (code page 437) drawn from a texture, similar to how Dwarf Fortress handles graphics. After getting everything up and working, I decided to instead make a sort of "library" for others to use alongside raylib for quickly laying the groundwork for making classic roguelike games.

This library is dependent on raylib. The only other thing required is a tileset. If you don't know where to get one, try here: https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tileset_repository

As of right now, only square tiles are supported. This may be changed in the future. I'll also write documentation once I get more planned features implemented.

Wasteland is just the codename and is subject to change.
